                <p>Hello, everyone! I’m Andrew and welcome to my website. Here you can find some information about me.
                    Head to my portfolio to see some of the work I completed during my coding bootcamp at the University
                    of Washington. Feel free to send me a message or ask a question via the contact page.</p>
                <p>A little about myself, I’m a UW graduate with a degree in linguistics with eight years of teaching
                    experience in Cambodia. I’ve been working as a first-grade teacher in the capitol Phnom Penh for the
                    last two years and despite enjoying the profession immensely, I’m not interested in continuing down
                    the career pathway in education stateside. Web development never really stood out to me until
                    recently but being really detail-oriented and naturally interested in the syntax and logic of
                    computer language has made me want to pursue it professionally. The design aspects of web
                    development also appeal to my need for a creative outlet.</p>
                <p>Outside of work and studying, I love to hike and travel. While living in Asia, I was able to travel
                    regularly throughout the region. Hiking along Tiger Leaping Gorge in Yunnan Province of China was a
                    highlight, as was jungle trekking and orangutan viewing in Borneo. Despite my love for travel I’m a
                    bit of a homebody and prefer to spend my evening reading, watching YouTube or playing board games
                    particularly Disney trivia games.</p>
